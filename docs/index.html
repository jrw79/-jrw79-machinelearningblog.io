This will be included in my blog, but I wanted to include it here as well. Although I think my performance metrics are on the right track, I believe some more work may need to be done in the feature selection area. A few of the features are inventories on mental state and affect. I'm not sure how necessary all of them are, and I'm concerned it may be taking some of the attention away from the demographic features. I think it's alright to include perhaps a couple, especially if they're self-report inventories and don't have to be completed by a licensed professional. However, I think including too many may cause the model to not be very useful, realistically. 

Another thing I've been considering is how to ensure I'm not misclassifying people who barely don't make the threshold of clinical anxiety. If the threshold is 39, someone who would score a 38 wouldn't be classified as a '1' in this model. However, they still have a decent amount of anxiety and shouldn't be ignored. I'm considering adding another class for those with moderate anxiety, but I'd like to do more literature review on the STAI before deciding the boundaries. Changing it from a binary classification would affect the logistic regression, though, so I'm not sure if there's a better way to approach the issue.
